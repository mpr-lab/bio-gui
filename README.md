# MPR-Bio-Remote (GUI)
This project is a java based graphical user interface (GUI), with an ssh-based python backend. The MPR Lab biological monitoring team works with raspberry pis and sensors to collect and sync data remotely through radio, cellular, or Wi-Fi. Its purpose is to deploy RPi modules to citizen biologists for their own research, however, the MotheterRemote and NFC projects which previously ran from a command line may not be intuitive for such audience. This GUI thus aims to make the technology more accessible for a wider range of people.
